    <h1>Stronger by Lazee ft Dead by April</h1>
    <p id="PrimerParrafo">The bottom line is, I know you bad for me but I find it complicated, seems where my mind is.
     On a mission to be where you are, I know where you are,
     I know I'm not far, but maybe I should be, to keep the distance from what could be.
     The biggest mistake in my life to ruin me, but look what you're doing to me.
     
     'Cause it's my problem, you see I'm addicted, but when you're gone I feel something's missing,
     But then I'm thinking, my fear for something's so close, you know there's a reason
     Seems that reason goes away, my mind says 'go' but my heart says 'wait'
     Push the pin to give me a break, before I go and make yourself a mistake.
     
     Take away all the tears
     Take away all the sorrow
     Holding me back from you
     Take me down, break me down, hold me down
     Can't fight back when you can't come around
     Seems I can't go without no sound
     Take away all the tears
     
     (Stronger)
     
     Constantly thinking about, what if I never find out,
     If I did it just the path that I chose to find a different route, I guess I'm trying to figure it out.
     Is it really that bad? I know that it is, foolin' myself and it makes me mad, gets me sad.
     And the fact that I know that it's tearin' me apart, but don't wanna be torn so bad.
     
     Thinkin' 'bout what I heard in the process, my family and friends - they know this.
     But you meant to have it in mind, come and chat behind, a different state of mind.
     I feel the fierce and don't know, wait, my mind says 'go' but my heart says 'wait'
     Push the pin to give me a break, before I go and make yourself a mistake.
     
     Take away all the tears
     Take away all the sorrow
     Holding me back from you
     Take me down, break me down, hold me down
     Can't fight back when you can't come around
     Seems I can't go without no sound
     Take away all the tears
     
     Take away the pain (stronger)
     It's holding me down, holding me back
     Take away the pain (stronger)
     It's holding me down, holding me back
     
     Take away all the sorrow, holding me back from you
     Take me down, break me down, hold me down
     Can't fight back when you can't come around
     Seems I can't go without no sound
     Take away all the tears</p>
